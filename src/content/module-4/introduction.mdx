Welcome to **Block 4 (Lessons 26-30): The Home Stretch**.

In this block, we will stop teaching new grammar. Now our focus is on **Strategy, Speed, and Psychology**. You know enough German to pass. Now you need to learn how to pass *this* test.

We start with the most exhausting module: **Reading (Leseverstehen)**.
